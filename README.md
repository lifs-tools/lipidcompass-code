[LipidCompass](https://lipidcompass.org) is a database and web application for the storage and analysis of lipidomics data. It is based on the mzTab-M format and provides a REST API for data access. A comprehensive user interface provides functions for interactive comparison and visualization of lipidomics data within and across studies. The project is structured as a set of microservices, which are deployed in a Docker environment.
