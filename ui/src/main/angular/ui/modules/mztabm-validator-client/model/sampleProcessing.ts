 * A list of parameters describing a sample processing, preparation or handling step similar to a biological or analytical methods report. The order of the sample_processing items should reflect the order these processing steps were performed in. If multiple parameters are given for a step these MUST be separated by a “|”. If derivatization was performed, it MUST be reported here as a general step, e.g. 'silylation' and the actual derivatization agens MUST be specified in the Section 6.2.54 part.
