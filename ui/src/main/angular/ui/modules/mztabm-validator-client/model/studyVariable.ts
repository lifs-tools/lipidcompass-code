/**
 * Specification of study_variable. (empty) name: A name for each study variable (experimental condition or factor), to serve as a list of the study variables that MUST be reported in the following tables. For software that does not capture study variables, a single study variable MUST be reported, linking to all assays. This single study variable MUST have the identifier “undefined“. assay_refs: Bar-separated references to the IDs of assays grouped in the study variable. average_function: The function used to calculate the study variable quantification value and the operation used is not arithmetic mean (default) e.g. “geometric mean”, “median”. The 1-n refers to different study variables. variation_function: The function used to calculate the study variable quantification variation value if it is reported and the operation used is not coefficient of variation (default) e.g. “standard error”. description: A textual description of the study variable. factors: Additional parameters or factors, separated by bars, that are known about study variables allowing the capture of more complex, such as nested designs.
